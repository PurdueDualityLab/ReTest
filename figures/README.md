## Figure Descriptions

### Figure 1: Bug Types by Engine (`bug_types_by_engine.pdf`)

A stacked horizontal bar chart showing the distribution of bug types (SEMANTIC, CRASH, MEMORY, PERF, DOC, OTHER) across 11 third-party regex engines. Semantic bugs form a plurality (35.3%) of all bugs overall.

- **Data source**: `data/bug_analysis/regex_bug_db.xlsx`
- **Generated by**: `scripts/analysis/regexbugbench_analysis.py`

### Figure 2: CVE Types by Engine (`cve_types_by_engine.pdf`)

A stacked bar chart showing the distribution of CVE severity levels and types across regex engines. Memory safety vulnerabilities dominate, accounting for 52% of all CVEs.

### Figure 4: Coverage Comparison (`coverage_comparison_30min.pdf`)

A line plot showing edge coverage over time for three fuzzing strategies:
- Naive fuzzing (OSS-Fuzz style): 11.9% final coverage
- Grammar-aware (V8 style): 13.5% final coverage
- ReTest: 40.2% final coverage (3× improvement)

## Regeneration
