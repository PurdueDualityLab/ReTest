unicode character classes have not been implemented yet.\n\nReference: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/index.htm\n\nLooks like fundamental character categories, such as `[\\p{P}]` (= any punctuations), are available:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/dlclark/regexp2\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    re := regexp2.MustCompile(`(?<=[カキケコ\\p{Po}])ん+`, 0) // works\n    isMatch, err := re.FindStringMatch(`ブック。んん`)\n    if err == nil {\n        fmt.Println(isMatch)\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nBut most advanced [character classes (block)](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/index.htm) such as `[\\p{Katakana}]` have not been implemented:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n

if err == nil {\n        fmt.Println(isMatch)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe sample code above causes `panic: not impelemented`.\n\nI hope you'd implement them in a future.\n", "closed_by": {"login":

In my tests this version gives very similar performance to your `BenchmarkTokenisationRunes`:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc BenchmarkTokenizationMatch(b *testing.B) {\r\n\ttext := strings.Repeat(\"one two three four five six seven eight nine ten\", 1000)\r\n\r\n\tr := MustCompile(`([a-z]+|\\s+)`, 0)\r\n\tb.ResetTimer()\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {\r\n\t\tm, err := r.FindStringMatch(text)\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\tb.Fatalf(\"Error: %v\", err)\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tfor m != nil {\r\n\t\t\tm, err = r.FindNextMatch(m)\r\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\t\tb.Fatalf(\"Error: %v\", err)\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the case where you eventually iterate the full string to get every match then `regexp2` is only about 15% slower than the built-in `regexp` library.  I'm not against optimizing this, but I'm not sure I'll be able to close that gap because of all the additional features in `regexp2`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the original issue still stands for those just wanting to get the first match.  On my machine getting the first match from your example benchmark takes `450 ns/op` with the `regexp` package and `61048 ns/op` with `regexp2` using strings or `584 ns/op` using runes.  Clearly pre-converting the entire large input to runes is a waste if you just want the first handful of characters as a match.  \r\n\r\nI'll investigate switching the engine to a \"calculate runes as we go\" design.  The present design is a hold-over from the original .NET engine -- strings in C# are stored as arrays of 16-bit characters so they get the \"rune\" conversion for free (though the .NET regex engine doesn't always properly handle 3-byte or larger runes because of this).  \r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks for the issue report.", "author_association": "OWNER", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/330107402/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "performed_via_github_app": null, "reactions_full": []}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/330108807", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2/issues/13#issuecomment-330108807", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/13", "id": 330108807, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDEwODgwNw==", "user": {"login": "alecthomas", "id": 41767, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzY3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41767?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas", "html_url": "https://github.com/alecthomas", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-09-18T01:28:05Z", "updated_at": "2017-09-18T01:28:05Z", "body": "I did find `FindNextMatch()` but it was not faster in my code, I'm not sure why.

"body": "I've looked into the example you gave and figured out a few things:\r\n\r\n1. The regex's were working, it was the test harness that was broken\r\nIn `tokeniseFast` you checked the `match == nil` for non-matches, but didn't check for what happens if the regex does match much further into the string.  You guard against this in `tokenise` with `match.Index > cursor` and need to add something similar to the \"fast\" version:\r\n```go\r\nif match == nil || match.Index > 0 || match.Length == 0 {\r\n   continue\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Your regex's overlap.  Everything that matches second pattern (`^-`) also matches the third pattern (`^(->|-|[<>()[\\]./])`) AND the input `->` matches the second pattern first and doesn't ever get to check the third pattern.  This means your second pattern really needs to be `^-(?!>)` or changed in order.\r\n\r\n3. With these fixes the \"fast\" version is now slower than the \"slow\" version by ~10%.  I think the speedup you were seeing was because large amounts of the input text due to issue #1 above you didn't have to execute as many regexes overall.  Unfortunately this produced the incorrect output.  \r\n\r\n4.  Tokenizing in this manner is just going to be slow.  I *highly* recommend you build a basic scanner for this.  Using the example tokens I built a simple scanner that matched the behavior (which has a few oddities, like numbers being the same kinds of tokens as string idents, string idents allowed to start with numbers, all special characters under a single token, etc).  I'm including the code here as a starting point.  The scanner system for the Go language itself is really simple and easy to follow, I'd recommend using it as a starting point (https://golang.org/src/go/scanner/scanner.go).\r\n\r\nHere's the code I slapped together as an example scanner for the grammar in your examples.  Even with the abbreviated grammar it performs roughly 1000x faster than using regexes...as the number of regex's grows that performance gap will get even wider.\r\n\r\n```go \r\npackage token_test\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"testing\"\r\n\t\"unicode\"\r\n\t\"unicode/utf8\"\r\n\r\n\t\"github.com/stretchr/testify/require\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nvar str = `\r\n-module(repl).\r\n\r\n-export([run/0]).\r\n\r\nrun() ->\r\n    read_eval_process().\r\n`\r\n\r\nvar expected = []token{\r\n\t{6, \"\\n\"}, {1, \"-\"}, {3, \"module\"}, {2, \"(\"}, {5, \"repl\"}, {2, \")\"}, {2, \".\"},\r\n\t{6, \"\\n\"}, {6, \"\\n\"}, {1, \"-\"}, {4, \"export\"}, {2, \"(\"}, {2, \"[\"}, {5, \"run\"},\r\n\t{2, \"/\"}, {5, \"0\"}, {2, \"]\"}, {2, \")\"}, {2, \".\"}, {6, \"\\n\"}, {6, \"\\n\"}, {5, \"run\"},\r\n\t{2, \"(\"}, {2, \")\"}, {0, \" \"}, {2, \"->\"}, {6, \"\\n\"}, {0, \"    \"},\r\n\t{5, \"read_eval_process\"}, {2, \"(\"}, {2, \")\"}, {2, \".\"}, {6, \"\\n\"},\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc TestRealFastTokenise(t *testing.T) {\r\n\ttokens := tokeniseRealFast(t, []rune(str))\r\n\trequire.Equal(t, expected, tokens)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc BenchmarkRealFastTokenise(b *testing.B) {\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {\r\n\t\ttokeniseRealFast(b, largeStr)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc tokeniseRealFast(t require.TestingT, str []rune) []token {\r\n\ts := NewScanner(str)\r\n\ttokens := []token{}\r\n\r\n\tfor {\r\n\t\t_, tok, lit := s.Scan()\r\n\r\n\t\tif tok == EOF {\r\n\t\t\tbreak\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\ttokens = append(tokens, token{int(tok - 1), lit})\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn tokens\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Token int\r\n\r\nconst (\r\n\tILLEGAL Token = iota\r\n\tSPACES\r\n\tDASH    // -\r\n\tSPECIAL // -> <>()[\\]./\r\n\tMODULE  // module\r\n\tEXPORT  // export\r\n\tIDENT   // non-keyword identifier of some kind\r\n\tNEWLINE // \\n\r\n\r\n\tEOF\r\n)\r\n\r\nvar keywords = map[string]Token{\r\n\t\"module\": MODULE,\r\n\t\"export\": EXPORT,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Lookup maps an identifier to its keyword token or IDENT (if not a keyword).\r\n//\r\nfunc Lookup(ident string) Token {\r\n\tif tok, isKeyword := keywords[ident]; isKeyword {\r\n\t\treturn tok\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn IDENT\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Scanner struct {\r\n\tsrc      []rune\r\n\tch       rune // current char\r\n\toffset   int  // char offset\r\n\trdOffset int  // reading offset (pos after current ch)\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst bom = 0xFEFF // byte order mark, only permitted as very first character\r\n\r\n// Read the next Unicode char into s.ch.\r\n// s.ch < 0 means end-of-file.\r\n//\r\nfunc (s *Scanner) next() {\r\n\tif s.rdOffset < len(s.src) {\r\n\t\ts.offset = s.rdOffset\r\n\t\ts.ch = s.src[s.rdOffset]\r\n\t\ts.rdOffset++\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\ts.offset = len(s.src)\r\n\t\ts.ch = -1 // eof\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// peek returns the rune following the most recently read character without\r\n// advancing the scanner.

use is something like `m, err := r.FindNextMatch(m)` since that will feel natural and uses a cached version of the runes.  In my tests this version gives very similar performance to your `BenchmarkTokenisationRunes`:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc BenchmarkTokenizationMatch(b *testing.B) {\r\n\ttext := strings.Repeat(\"one two three four five six seven eight nine ten\", 1000)\r\n\r\n\tr := MustCompile(`([a-z]+|\\s+)`, 0)\r\n\tb.ResetTimer()\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {\r\n\t\tm, err := r.FindStringMatch(text)\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\tb.Fatalf(\"Error: %v\", err)\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tfor m != nil {\r\n\t\t\tm, err = r.FindNextMatch(m)\r\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\t\tb.Fatalf(\"Error: %v\", err)\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the case where you eventually iterate the full string to get every match then `regexp2` is only about 15% slower than the built-in `regexp` library.  I'm not against optimizing this, but I'm not sure I'll be able to close that gap because of all the additional features in `regexp2`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the original issue still stands for those just wanting to get the first match.  On my machine getting the first match from your example benchmark takes `450 ns/op` with the `regexp` package and `61048 ns/op` with `regexp2` using strings or `584 ns/op` using runes.  Clearly pre-converting the entire large input to runes is a waste if you just want the first handful of characters as a match.  \r\n\r\nI'll investigate switching the engine to a \"calculate runes as we go\" design.  The present design is a hold-over from the original .NET engine -- strings in C# are stored as arrays of 16-bit characters so they get the \"rune\" conversion for free (though the .NET regex engine doesn't always properly handle 3-byte or larger runes because of this).  \r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks for the issue report.", "author_association": "OWNER", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/330107402/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "performed_via_github_app": null, "event": "commented", "actor": {"login": "dlclark", "id": 3393212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMyMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/330108807", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2/issues/13#issuecomment-330108807", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/13", "id": 330108807, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDEwODgwNw==", "user": {"login": "alecthomas", "id": 41767, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzY3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41767?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas", "html_url": "https://github.com/alecthomas", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alecthomas/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-09-18T01:28:05Z", "updated_at": "2017-09-18T01:28:05Z", "body": "I did find `FindNextMatch()` but it was not faster in my code, I'm not sure why.

Chroma's approach of matching multiple regular expressions against the \"next\" token using `FindRunesMatchStartingAt(re, cursor)`.\r\n\r\nGiven the text `some text to tokenise` and the tokenising regexes `\\s+` and `\\w+`, if all patterns are being matched against the cursor position, this is what will occur:\r\n\r\n1. input: `some text...` re: `\\s+` (will scan the first 4 characters and match the 5th, but will be rejected as it's not at the beginning of the input)\r\n2. input: `some text...` re: `\\w+` will scan and match `some`\r\n\r\nStep 1 is the problem. The obvious solution is to anchor the regex with `^`, but this means that multi-line regexes will no longer match the start of a line. This is what I'm currently doing, as without it performance degrades by several orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark-8   \t       1\t55196400363 ns/op\t68033096 B/op\t 1034663

the \"beginning\" of the string or offset would solve this problem, but maybe there's some other solution I'm not seeing?", "author_association": "NONE", "reactions": {"url":

The regex's were working, it was the test harness that was broken\r\nIn `tokeniseFast` you checked the `match == nil` for non-matches, but didn't check for what happens if the regex does match much further into the string.  You guard against this in `tokenise` with `match.Index > cursor` and need to add something similar to the \"fast\" version:\r\n```go\r\nif match == nil || match.Index > 0 || match.Length == 0 {\r\n   continue\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Your regex's overlap.  Everything that matches second pattern (`^-`) also matches the third pattern (`^(->|-|[<>()[\\]./])`) AND the input `->` matches the second pattern first and doesn't ever get to check the third pattern.  This means your second pattern really needs to be `^-(?!>)` or changed in order.\r\n\r\n3. With these fixes the \"fast\" version is now slower than the \"slow\" version by ~10%.  I think the speedup you were seeing was because large amounts of the input text due to issue #1 above you didn't have to execute as many regexes overall.  Unfortunately this produced the incorrect output.  \r\n\r\n4.  Tokenizing in this manner is just going to be slow.  I *highly* recommend you build a basic scanner for this.  Using the example tokens I built a simple scanner that matched the behavior (which has a few oddities, like numbers being the same kinds of tokens as string idents, string idents allowed to start with numbers, all special characters under a single token, etc).  I'm including the code here as a starting point.  The scanner system for the Go language itself is really simple and easy to follow, I'd recommend using it as a starting point (https://golang.org/src/go/scanner/scanner.go).\r\n\r\nHere's the code I slapped together as an example scanner for the grammar in your examples.  Even with the abbreviated grammar it performs roughly 1000x faster than using regexes...as the number of regex's grows that performance gap will get even wider.\r\n\r\n```go \r\npackage token_test\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"testing\"\r\n\t\"unicode\"\r\n\t\"unicode/utf8\"\r\n\r\n\t\"github.com/stretchr/testify/require\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nvar str = `\r\n-module(repl).\r\n\r\n-export([run/0]).\r\n\r\nrun() ->\r\n    read_eval_process().\r\n`\r\n\r\nvar expected = []token{\r\n\t{6, \"\\n\"}, {1, \"-\"}, {3, \"module\"}, {2, \"(\"}, {5, \"repl\"}, {2, \")\"}, {2, \".\"},\r\n\t{6, \"\\n\"}, {6, \"\\n\"}, {1, \"-\"}, {4, \"export\"}, {2, \"(\"}, {2, \"[\"}, {5, \"run\"},\r\n\t{2, \"/\"}, {5, \"0\"}, {2, \"]\"}, {2, \")\"}, {2, \".\"}, {6, \"\\n\"}, {6, \"\\n\"}, {5, \"run\"},\r\n\t{2, \"(\"}, {2, \")\"}, {0, \" \"}, {2, \"->\"}, {6, \"\\n\"}, {0, \"    \"},\r\n\t{5, \"read_eval_process\"}, {2, \"(\"}, {2, \")\"}, {2, \".\"}, {6, \"\\n\"},\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc TestRealFastTokenise(t *testing.T) {\r\n\ttokens := tokeniseRealFast(t, []rune(str))\r\n\trequire.Equal(t, expected, tokens)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc BenchmarkRealFastTokenise(b *testing.B) {\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {\r\n\t\ttokeniseRealFast(b, largeStr)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc tokeniseRealFast(t require.TestingT, str []rune) []token {\r\n\ts := NewScanner(str)\r\n\ttokens := []token{}\r\n\r\n\tfor {\r\n\t\t_, tok, lit := s.Scan()\r\n\r\n\t\tif tok == EOF {\r\n\t\t\tbreak\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\ttokens = append(tokens, token{int(tok - 1), lit})\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn tokens\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Token int\r\n\r\nconst (\r\n\tILLEGAL Token = iota\r\n\tSPACES\r\n\tDASH    // -\r\n\tSPECIAL // -> <>()[\\]./\r\n\tMODULE  // module\r\n\tEXPORT  // export\r\n\tIDENT   // non-keyword identifier of some kind\r\n\tNEWLINE // \\n\r\n\r\n\tEOF\r\n)\r\n\r\nvar keywords = map[string]Token{\r\n\t\"module\": MODULE,\r\n\t\"export\": EXPORT,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Lookup maps an identifier to its keyword token or IDENT (if not a keyword).\r\n//\r\nfunc Lookup(ident string) Token {\r\n\tif tok, isKeyword := keywords[ident]; isKeyword {\r\n\t\treturn tok\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn IDENT\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Scanner struct {\r\n\tsrc      []rune\r\n\tch       rune // current char\r\n\toffset   int  // char offset\r\n\trdOffset int  // reading offset (pos after current ch)\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst bom = 0xFEFF // byte order mark, only permitted as very first character\r\n\r\n// Read the next Unicode char into s.ch.\r\n// s.ch < 0 means end-of-file.\r\n//\r\nfunc (s *Scanner) next() {\r\n\tif s.rdOffset < len(s.src) {\r\n\t\ts.offset = s.rdOffset\r\n\t\ts.ch = s.src[s.rdOffset]\r\n\t\ts.rdOffset++\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\ts.offset = len(s.src)\r\n\t\ts.ch = -1 // eof\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// peek returns the rune following the most recently read character without\r\n// advancing the scanner.

You can see this by changing the engine on the left side here: https://regex101.com/r/hUAttU/1\r\nGo (RE2) and Javascript don't match,  but PHP/PCRE and Python do.\r\n\r\nThe definition for `$` in PCRE-based engines without Multiline is: `$ asserts position at the end of the string, or before the line terminator right at the end of the string (if any).`  That means that the pattern `$\\n` will match the text `\\n` -- the `$` will match the newline but is zero-width so it won't advance the pattern, and then the explicit `\\n` will match and advance the pattern.\r\n\r\nHonestly the behavior is counter-intuitive, but it's an edge case that I maintain for compatibility with the other Javascript engines (including C#, Python, and PCRE).  I recently added an `RE` option to increase compatibility with existing Go regex's when needed -- would you like me to add this case to it?\r\n\r\nIf I misunderstood please provide a code example so I can review it in more detail.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "author_association": "OWNER", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/583232402/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "performed_via_github_app": null, "reactions_full": []}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/679928255", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2/issues/24#issuecomment-679928255", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/24", "id": 679928255, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3OTkyODI1NQ==", "user": {"login": "dop251", "id": 995021, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTAyMQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/995021?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251", "html_url": "https://github.com/dop251", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2020-08-25T09:57:21Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-25T09:57:21Z", "body": "Sorry, just spotted this.

You can see this by changing the engine on the left side here: https://regex101.com/r/hUAttU/1\r\nGo (RE2) and Javascript don't match,  but PHP/PCRE and Python do.\r\n\r\nThe definition for `$` in PCRE-based engines without Multiline is: `$ asserts position at the end of the string, or before the line terminator right at the end of the string (if any).`  That means that the pattern `$\\n` will match the text `\\n` -- the `$` will match the newline but is zero-width so it won't advance the pattern, and then the explicit `\\n` will match and advance the pattern.\r\n\r\nHonestly the behavior is counter-intuitive, but it's an edge case that I maintain for compatibility with the other Javascript engines (including C#, Python, and PCRE).  I recently added an `RE` option to increase compatibility with existing Go regex's when needed -- would you like me to add this case to it?\r\n\r\nIf I misunderstood please provide a code example so I can review it in more detail.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "author_association": "OWNER", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/583232402/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "performed_via_github_app": null, "event": "commented", "actor": {"login": "dlclark", "id": 3393212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMyMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}}, {"id": 3682455156, "node_id": "MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzY4MjQ1NTE1Ng==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/events/3682455156", "actor": {"login": "dlclark", "id": 3393212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMyMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "event": "closed", "commit_id": null, "commit_url": null, "created_at": "2020-08-23T01:54:14Z", "state_reason": null, "performed_via_github_app": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/679928255", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2/issues/24#issuecomment-679928255", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/24", "id": 679928255, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3OTkyODI1NQ==", "user": {"login": "dop251", "id": 995021, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTAyMQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/995021?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251", "html_url": "https://github.com/dop251", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dop251/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2020-08-25T09:57:21Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-25T09:57:21Z", "body": "Sorry, just spotted this.

I've confirmed it happens in the .NET regex engine that `regexp2` is based on.\r\n\r\nDuring the second match it seems like the regex stack is getting out of sync, so when the `Capturemark` operation tries to pop the start of the capture it it should get a `2` but there's an extra `1` left over from a previous `Lazybranchmark` operation.  It seems the `Lazybranchmark` operation is setting up the stack for a backtrack that isn't _guaranteed_ to happen... and if it doesn't happen then the stack has extra items on it.\r\n\r\nSo, more digging is needed to figure out the best way to resolve the issue.  Can `Lazybranchmark` detect if there's a backtrack ahead?  How often does the stack get out of sync?  Can `Capturemark` detect the problem and pop extra items from the stack?  \r\n\r\nI'll need to do more research and digging, but wanted to capture my research and thoughts so far.",

I've confirmed it happens in the .NET regex engine that `regexp2` is based on.\r\n\r\nDuring the second match it seems like the regex stack is getting out of sync, so when the `Capturemark` operation tries to pop the start of the capture it it should get a `2` but there's an extra `1` left over from a previous `Lazybranchmark` operation.  It seems the `Lazybranchmark` operation is setting up the stack for a backtrack that isn't _guaranteed_ to happen... and if it doesn't happen then the stack has extra items on it.\r\n\r\nSo, more digging is needed to figure out the best way to resolve the issue.  Can `Lazybranchmark` detect if there's a backtrack ahead?  How often does the stack get out of sync?  Can `Capturemark` detect the problem and pop extra items from the stack?  \r\n\r\nI'll need to do more research and digging, but wanted to capture my research and thoughts so far.",

First, thanks for this great library - this is an impressive feat!\r\n\r\nI needed an equivalent function for https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/#Regexp.FindAllString which ideally would be a part of this library, but unfortunately doesn't exist today. I took a stab at implementing it (without the `n` parameter):\r\n\r\n```Go\r\nfunc regexp2FindAllString(re *regexp2.Regexp, s string) []string {\r\n\tvar matches []string\r\n\tfor {\r\n\t\tmatch, _ := re.FindStringMatch(s)\r\n\t\tif match == nil {\r\n\t\t\tbreak\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tmatches = append(matches, match.String())\r\n\t\t\ts = s[match.Index+match.Length:]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn matches\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first glance, this seemed correct and appeared to work - however I realized that it in fact is incompatible with unicode because `match.Length` appears to report length in _runes_ not bytes. I'm not sure whether or not `Capture.Index` reports _bytes_ or _runes_ either, and the docs don't define this:\r\n\r\n```Go\r\n    // the position in the original string where the first character of\r\n    // captured substring was found.\r\n    Index int\r\n    // the length of the captured substring.\r\n    Length int\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom testing, it appears that `Capture.Index` oddly _is in bytes and not runes_. A corrected implementation is:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nfunc regexp2FindAllString(re *regexp2.Regexp, s string) []string {\r\n\tvar matches []string\r\n\tfor {\r\n\t\tmatch, _ := re.FindStringMatch(s)\r\n\t\tif match == nil {\r\n\t\t\tbreak\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tmatches = append(matches, match.String())\r\n-\t\t\ts = s[match.Index+match.Length:]\r\n+\t\t\ts = s[match.Index+len(match.String()):]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn matches\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my points of feedback:\r\n\r\n1. `Index` in bytes and `Length` in runes is an odd inconsistency, I imagine they should be the same.\r\n2. The docstrings should ideally clarify this.\r\n3. It would be great if the library exposed a `FindAllString` implementation\r\n\r\nThanks again for the great library!", "closed_by": {"login": "dlclark", "id": 3393212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMyMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/35/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/35/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, "fetched_at": "2025-11-15T03:17:22.508733+00:00", "comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/706766924", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2/issues/35#issuecomment-706766924", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/35", "id": 706766924, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjc2NjkyNA==", "user": {"login": "emidoots", "id": 3173176, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzMxNzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3173176?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots", "html_url": "https://github.com/emidoots", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2020-10-11T20:55:27Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-11T20:55:27Z", "body": "OK, it turns out I was wrong and both `Index` and `Length` are in runes.

"body": "Ok based on what @dop251 found it appears that the issue is that Atomic operations require 64-bit alignment on 32-bit architectures.  \r\n\r\nI _think_ the culprit is that the `fastclock` has a `time.Time` before using `atomicTime`. Since `time.Time` ends with a pointer (which would only be 32 bits for x86) we'll get off our alignment.  To fix this I _think_ we can just add a spacer to the `fastclock` struct (in fastclock.go): \r\n```golang\r\ntype fastclock struct {\r\n\t// current and clockEnd can be read via atomic loads.\r\n\t// Reads and writes of other fields require mu to be held.\r\n\tmu sync.Mutex\r\n\r\n\tstart time.Time // Time corresponding to fasttime(0)\r\n\t//spacer for x86 arch\r\n\t_        int\r\n\tcurrent  atomicTime // Current time (approximate)\r\n\tclockEnd atomicTime // When clock updater is supposed to stop (>= any existing deadline)\r\n\trunning  bool       // Is a clock updater running?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have a 32-bit test environment.  @gandarez @alanhamlett are you able to make the above change locally and check if it fixes the issue?",

"body": "Ok based on what @dop251 found it appears that the issue is that Atomic operations require 64-bit alignment on 32-bit architectures.  \r\n\r\nI _think_ the culprit is that the `fastclock` has a `time.Time` before using `atomicTime`. Since `time.Time` ends with a pointer (which would only be 32 bits for x86) we'll get off our alignment.  To fix this I _think_ we can just add a spacer to the `fastclock` struct (in fastclock.go): \r\n```golang\r\ntype fastclock struct {\r\n\t// current and clockEnd can be read via atomic loads.\r\n\t// Reads and writes of other fields require mu to be held.\r\n\tmu sync.Mutex\r\n\r\n\tstart time.Time // Time corresponding to fasttime(0)\r\n\t//spacer for x86 arch\r\n\t_        int\r\n\tcurrent  atomicTime // Current time (approximate)\r\n\tclockEnd atomicTime // When clock updater is supposed to stop (>= any existing deadline)\r\n\trunning  bool       // Is a clock updater running?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have a 32-bit test environment.  @gandarez @alanhamlett are you able to make the above change locally and check if it fixes the issue?",

Are you seeing multiple goroutines being created for timeouts? Or just the one maintenance goroutine?\r\n\r\nIf you use timeouts the design has a single ongoing goroutine to maintain the timeouts. That goroutine should exist for the longest timeout set by the user (even if the regex finishes before the timeout).  I don’t consider that a leak because the resources are fixed and knowable up front.

Possible that this is stemming from my poor regex knowledge, and not necessarily regexp2. \r\n\r\nThanks for any pointers!", "closed_by": {"login": "arunsathiya", "id": 18581859, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTgxODU5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18581859?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya", "html_url": "https://github.com/arunsathiya", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/74/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/74/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, "fetched_at": "2025-11-15T03:17:45.917206+00:00", "comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/1848263341", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2/issues/74#issuecomment-1848263341", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/74", "id": 1848263341, "node_id": "IC_kwDOAumpjc5uKkKt", "user": {"login": "arunsathiya", "id": 18581859, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTgxODU5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18581859?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya", "html_url": "https://github.com/arunsathiya", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arunsathiya/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2023-12-09T06:30:18Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-09T06:30:18Z", "body": "Oh, I got a tip from regex101: https://regex101.com/r/G4fr9Q/1 I should be looking for group 1, not 0!

Since it's risky to use a regex with a repeating charset with an optional terminator I recommend you either tighten your pattern a lot OR even better, if you need parse file paths I recommend you use the `path/filepath` package.", "author_association": "OWNER", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/1879920568/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "performed_via_github_app": null, "event": "commented", "actor": {"login": "dlclark", "id": 3393212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMyMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}}, {"id": 11410151451, "node_id": "CE_lADOAumpjc566ChJzwAAAAKoGRgb", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/events/11410151451", "actor": {"login": "dlclark", "id": 3393212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMyMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "event": "closed", "commit_id": null, "commit_url": null, "created_at": "2024-01-07T02:47:09Z", "state_reason": null, "performed_via_github_app": null}], "errors": {"reactions": null, "events": null, "timeline": null}}

This is a dramatic difference between regexp and regexp2. It's >advisable to use the provided String() methods to avoid having to work with indices.\r\n\r\nIf I had to do it over again I'd have named them `RuneIndex` and `RuneLength` for clarity.  \r\n\r\nIf you need the string indices for some reason then you'll need to convert the rune-based index/length to the string with a function like this:\r\n```golang\r\nfunc convertRuneIndexToStringIndex(s string, runeIndex, runeLength int) (stringIndex, stringLength int) {\r\n\tvar curStrIdx, startIdx int\r\n\r\n\t// first get the start index\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < runeIndex; i++ {\r\n\t\t_, size := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(s[curStrIdx:])\r\n\t\tcurStrIdx += size\r\n\t}\r\n\tstartIdx = curStrIdx\r\n\r\n\t// now get the length\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < runeLength; i++ {\r\n\t\t_, size := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(s[curStrIdx:])\r\n\t\tcurStrIdx += size\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn startIdx, curStrIdx - startIdx\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis naive version iterates the string every time, so if you were going to need performance to convert these indices for the same input string a bunch I'd use `FindRunesMatch` so I only have to convert from `string` to `[]rune` one time and then use an index conversion function like this instead:\r\n```golang\r\nfunc convertRuneIndexToStringIndex(r []rune, runeIndex, runeLength int) (stringIndex, stringLength int) {\r\n\tvar curStrIdx, startIdx int\r\n\r\n\t// first get the start index\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < runeIndex; i++ {\r\n\t\tcurStrIdx += utf8.RuneLen(r[i])\r\n\t}\r\n\tstartIdx = curStrIdx\r\n\r\n\t// now get the length\r\n\tfor i := runeIndex; i < runeIndex+runeLength; i++ {\r\n\t\tcurStrIdx += utf8.RuneLen(r[i])\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn startIdx, curStrIdx - startIdx\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBenchmarks on my machine show it's about twice as fast and for short input strings it might be faster overall to just convert your string with `[]rune(\"string\")` and then use this version. The performance tradeoffs between them depend on how deep into the string you're searching, how long your string is, how many times you'll be searching, etc.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",

"body": "This is definitely counter-intuitive, but it is the documented, expected behavior:\r\n>The internals of regexp2 always operate on []rune so Index and Length data in a Match always reference a position in runes >rather than bytes (even if the input was given as a string). This is a dramatic difference between regexp and regexp2. It's >advisable to use the provided String() methods to avoid having to work with indices.\r\n\r\nIf I had to do it over again I'd have named them `RuneIndex` and `RuneLength` for clarity.  \r\n\r\nIf you need the string indices for some reason then you'll need to convert the rune-based index/length to the string with a function like this:\r\n```golang\r\nfunc convertRuneIndexToStringIndex(s string, runeIndex, runeLength int) (stringIndex, stringLength int) {\r\n\tvar curStrIdx, startIdx int\r\n\r\n\t// first get the start index\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < runeIndex; i++ {\r\n\t\t_, size := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(s[curStrIdx:])\r\n\t\tcurStrIdx += size\r\n\t}\r\n\tstartIdx = curStrIdx\r\n\r\n\t// now get the length\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < runeLength; i++ {\r\n\t\t_, size := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(s[curStrIdx:])\r\n\t\tcurStrIdx += size\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn startIdx, curStrIdx - startIdx\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis naive version iterates the string every time, so if you were going to need performance to convert these indices for the same input string a bunch I'd use `FindRunesMatch` so I only have to convert from `string` to `[]rune` one time and then use an index conversion function like this instead:\r\n```golang\r\nfunc convertRuneIndexToStringIndex(r []rune, runeIndex, runeLength int) (stringIndex, stringLength int) {\r\n\tvar curStrIdx, startIdx int\r\n\r\n\t// first get the start index\r\n\tfor i := 0; i < runeIndex; i++ {\r\n\t\tcurStrIdx += utf8.RuneLen(r[i])\r\n\t}\r\n\tstartIdx = curStrIdx\r\n\r\n\t// now get the length\r\n\tfor i := runeIndex; i < runeIndex+runeLength; i++ {\r\n\t\tcurStrIdx += utf8.RuneLen(r[i])\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn startIdx, curStrIdx - startIdx\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBenchmarks on my machine show it's about twice as fast and for short input strings it might be faster overall to just convert your string with `[]rune(\"string\")` and then use this version. The performance tradeoffs between them depend on how deep into the string you're searching, how long your string is, how many times you'll be searching, etc.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",

This results in invalid matches where non-whitespace characters are treated as whitespace.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. **Create a Go Program**:\r\n\r\n   ```go\r\n   package main\r\n\r\n   import (\r\n       \"fmt\"\r\n       \"github.com/dlclark/regexp2\"\r\n   )\r\n\r\n   func main() {\r\n       p := regexp2.MustCompile(`\\s+`, regexp2.None)\r\n       inside := \"𝔾𝕠𝕠𝕕 𝕞𝕠𝕣𝕟𝕚𝕟𝕘\"\r\n       match, err := p.FindStringMatch(inside)\r\n       if err != nil {\r\n           fmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\r\n           return\r\n       }\r\n       if match != nil {\r\n           fmt.Printf(\"Match: %q at [%d-%d]\\n\", inside[match.Index:match.Index+match.Length], match.Index, match.Index+match.Length)\r\n       } else {\r\n           fmt.Println(\"No match found\")\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Run the Program**:\r\n\r\n   Ensure you have Go installed and the `regexp2` library fetched. Then execute:\r\n\r\n   ```sh\r\n   go run main.go\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\nThe regular expression `\\s+` should only match whitespace characters. In the string `\"𝔾𝕠𝕠𝕕 𝕞𝕠𝕣𝕟𝕚𝕟𝕘\"`, it should match the single space `\" \"` at byte offsets `[16-17]`.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\nThe regular expression incorrectly matches the byte `\\xf0` at byte offsets `[4-5]`, which is part of the Unicode character `\"𝕠\"`.

I'm using the `regexp2.ECMAScript` parsing option in my script:\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/dlclark/regexp2\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tr1 := regexp2.MustCompile(`(x) (foo) bar`, regexp2.ECMAScript)\n\tfor _, name := range r1.GetGroupNames() {\n\t\tprintln(name)\n\t}\n\n\tprintln(\"----\")\n\n\tr2 := regexp2.MustCompile(`(x) (?<1>foo) (?<2>bar)`, regexp2.ECMAScript)\n\tfor _, name := range r2.GetGroupNames() {\n\t\tprintln(name)\n\t}\n}\n\n```\n\nThe two regexps compile correctly, and both `for` loops output exactly the same thing. However, I'm wondering if this creates a sort of ambiguity: in `re1`, there's two unnamed capture groups, in `re2`, there's three capture groups, two of them named, but from the point of view of `GetGroupNames`, they are identical. So then, some questions:\n\n1. Is there a way of retrieving the original information, i.e. what the original expression **explicitly** named each capture group as?\n2. Additionally, why does the second expression produce 3 groups instead of 4? I assumed that group index 0 was the whole expression, and then there would be 3 more (1 unnamed, 2 named).\n\nContext: in the development of an JS interpreter in Go, one needs to know if the capture group was explicitly named e.g. `2`, or if `regexp2` simply assigned this name. This is because group names in JS need to be valid identifiers, and `2` is not one. However, I have not found a way of disambiguating this situation. Interestingly, naming a group e.g. `2foo` does break the parsing, which is in-line to how ECMAScript works.\n\n3. Maybe instead of exposing the original names used in the expression, `regexp2.ECMAScript` could also ensure that the group names are all valid ECMAScript identifiers?\n\nThanks!", "closed_by": {"login": "dlclark", "id": 3393212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMyMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/94/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/94/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, "fetched_at": "2025-11-15T03:17:56.884813+00:00", "comments": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/2767099072", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2/issues/94#issuecomment-2767099072", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/94", "id": 2767099072, "node_id": "IC_kwDOAumpjc6k7pTA", "user": {"login": "dlclark", "id": 3393212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMyMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2025-03-31T18:43:27Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-31T18:43:27Z", "body": "This is behavior imported from the C# regex engine.

If so, I'd definitely consider a PR that has a new function to return only non-numbered named groups via a new function so these engines could use it if they wanted.", "author_association": "OWNER", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/2767408384/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "performed_via_github_app": null, "event": "commented", "actor": {"login": "dlclark", "id": 3393212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMyMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlclark/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/comments/2768671855", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2/issues/94#issuecomment-2768671855", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/94", "id": 2768671855, "node_id": "IC_kwDOAumpjc6lBpRv", "user": {"login": "federicotdn", "id": 6868935, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY4Njg5MzU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6868935?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn", "html_url": "https://github.com/federicotdn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/federicotdn/received_events", "type": "User", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2025-04-01T09:00:07Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-01T09:00:07Z", "body": "Sounds good!

now record the names of the capture groups as they appeared literally in the regexp.

Maybe \"raw group names\" is not the correct term to use here, I could change it. What I currently dislike about this approach is that GetRawGroupNames() does not return a slice of the same length as GetGroupNames(), plus the groups do not appear in the same order as well (due to how `assignNameSlots()` can modify the slice of names stored in `capnamelist`).\r\nI can add comments and unit tests if we agree on the overall design.\r\n\r\nEdit: alternative names could be:\r\n- \"explicitly named groups\"\r\n- \"directly named groups\"\r\n- \"literal named groups\"", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/95/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dlclark/regexp2/issues/95/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}}, "event": "cross-referenced"}], "errors": {"reactions": null, "events": null, "timeline": null}}
