bug.\n* Set to `true` if the issue is a real bug, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **is_fixed**\n\n* Whether the bug was fixed.\n* Set to `true` if the bug was fixed, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **number**\n\n* The issue number.\n* You already know this from the issue report input, but you need to output it as well.\n\n#### **found_pointer**\n\n* The version, commit hash, or pull request number where the bug was observed.\n* The primary aim here is to pinpoint the locations so that we can rollback and reproduce the bug.\n* If multiple of those are mentioned, you can add them all to the array.\n* Must come directly from the issue text or comments.\n* Return `[]` if not any kind of pointer to at which point the bug was found is explicitly stated.\n\n#### **fixed_pointer**\n\n* The

documentation** |\n| **OTHER**    | A genuine bug that does not fit any other category                        |\n\n\nFor `DIFF` bugs, behavioral differences can be observed in the two different versions of the same engine (e.g., new version vs. old version)\nand between different engines (e.g., tre vs. other engines). The behavioral difference can be in the acceptance of a pattern, \nthe span of the match, the captures, the number of matches, flag behavior, etc.\n\n#### **how_found**\n\nIdentify how the bug was discovered, if stated or there is enough evidence (e.g., usage of ASan for fuzzing):\n\n* FUZZING – found via fuzzing tools\n* STATIC_ANALYSIS – found via automated static analysis\n* MANUAL_REVIEW – found manually (e.g., user investigation)\n* DIFFERENTIAL_TESTING – found by comparing results with other engines\n* OTHER – explicitly stated custom method\n* `null` – if no discovery method is stated or implied\n\n#### **reproduction_pattern_and_input**\n\n* Extract all reproducible test cases provided.\n* Store each `(pattern, input)` pair separately (there can be multiple pairs).\n* Use `null` values only when the pattern or input is missing.\n* Sometimes, the provided pattern or input string is too long to be fit in the output format (e.g., excessive repeats of the same character or pattern).\n  * For example, the issue author might state a regex pattern or input similar to \"()()()...()\" (10000 times \"()\"). \n  * In this case, you can output a shorter representation like \"()()...()\" (50 times \"()\"). Mention that truncation in your summary.\n\n#### **log**\n\n* Include any crash logs, sanitizer output, stack traces, or diagnostic logs.\n* Store **exactly** what is provided, do not invent or summarize.\n* Use `null` if not present.\n\n#### **summary**\n\nA **2–6 sentence** explanation summarizing:\n\n* What the issue reports.\n* Whether and why it qualifies (or does not qualify) as a real bug.\n* Your reasoning for the chosen bug category and extracted fields.\n\nThis is the **only place where your reasoning may appear**.\nAll other fields should contain **no justification—only extracted data**.\n\n---\n\n# **If the Issue Is NOT a Real Bug**\n\nOutput the structure with all fields set to null or empty as below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"number\": \"1234567890\",\n    \"is_real_bug\": false,\n    \"is_fixed\": false,\n    \"found_pointer\": [],\n    \"fixed_pointer\": [],\n    \"bug_kind\": null,\n    \"how_found\": null,\n    \"reproduction_pattern_and_input\": [],\n    \"log\": null,\n    \"summary\": \"Explanation of why this issue does not represent a real bug.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe number and summary must still be present; all other fields must be null or empty.\n\n---\n\n# **General Constraints**\n\n1. **Do not guess.** Only extract what is explicitly stated or can be strongly inferred from the issue description and comments.\n2. **Do not modify or correct the issue's content.** Extract it faithfully.\n3. **Only JSON output, no extra text.**\n4. **Ensure JSON is valid, syntactically correct, and uses only the allowed values.**\n5. **Never fabricate version numbers, logs, or test cases.**\n6. **Be consistent and precise.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"number\": \"4\", \"title\": \"autopoint package required on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\", \"author\": \"nathanhaigh\", \"labels\": [\"enhancement\"], \"description\": \"In order to build tre on Ubuntu 12.04, you also need to install autopoint, which is currently not documented in README.darcs.

The behavioral difference can be in the acceptance of a pattern, \nthe span of the match, the captures, the number of matches, flag behavior, etc.\n\n#### **how_found**\n\nIdentify how the bug was discovered, if stated or there is enough evidence (e.g., usage of ASan for fuzzing):\n\n* FUZZING – found via fuzzing tools\n* STATIC_ANALYSIS – found via automated static analysis\n* MANUAL_REVIEW – found manually (e.g., user investigation)\n* DIFFERENTIAL_TESTING – found by comparing results with other engines\n* OTHER – explicitly stated custom method\n* `null` – if no discovery method is stated or implied\n\n#### **reproduction_pattern_and_input**\n\n* Extract all reproducible test cases provided.\n* Store each `(pattern, input)` pair separately (there can be multiple pairs).\n* Use `null` values only when the pattern or input is missing.\n* Sometimes, the provided pattern or input string is too long to be fit in the output format (e.g., excessive repeats of the same character or pattern).\n  * For example, the issue author might state a regex pattern or input similar to \"()()()...()\" (10000 times \"()\"). \n  * In this case, you can output a shorter representation like \"()()...()\" (50 times \"()\"). Mention that truncation in your summary.\n\n#### **log**\n\n* Include any crash logs, sanitizer output, stack traces, or diagnostic logs.\n* Store **exactly** what is provided, do not invent or summarize.\n* Use `null` if not present.\n\n#### **summary**\n\nA **2–6 sentence** explanation summarizing:\n\n* What the issue reports.\n* Whether and why it qualifies (or does not qualify) as a real bug.\n* Your reasoning for the chosen bug category and extracted fields.\n\nThis is the **only place where your reasoning may appear**.\nAll other fields should contain **no justification—only extracted data**.\n\n---\n\n# **If the Issue Is NOT a Real Bug**\n\nOutput the structure with all fields set to null or empty as below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"number\": \"1234567890\",\n    \"is_real_bug\": false,\n    \"is_fixed\": false,\n    \"found_pointer\": [],\n    \"fixed_pointer\": [],\n    \"bug_kind\": null,\n    \"how_found\": null,\n    \"reproduction_pattern_and_input\": [],\n    \"log\": null,\n    \"summary\": \"Explanation of why this issue does not represent a real bug.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe number and summary must still be present; all other fields must be null or empty.\n\n---\n\n# **General Constraints**\n\n1. **Do not guess.** Only extract what is explicitly stated or can be strongly inferred from the issue description and comments.\n2. **Do not modify or correct the issue's content.** Extract it faithfully.\n3. **Only JSON output, no extra text.**\n4. **Ensure JSON is valid, syntactically correct, and uses only the allowed values.**\n5. **Never fabricate version numbers, logs, or test cases.**\n6. **Be consistent and precise.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"number\": \"38\", \"title\": \"can't build on Ubuntu\", \"author\": \"isomorphisms\", \"labels\": [], \"description\": \"Here is the error I get when I try to run `./configure`:\\n\\n```\\nchecking build system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu\\nchecking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu\\nchecking target system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu\\nchecking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c\\nchecking whether build environment is sane... yes\\nchecking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p\\nchecking for gawk... gawk\\nchecking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes\\nchecking for gcc... gcc\\nchecking whether the C compiler works... yes\\nchecking for C compiler default output file name... a.out\\nchecking for suffix of executables... \\nchecking whether we are cross compiling... no\\nchecking for suffix of object files... o\\nchecking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes\\nchecking whether gcc accepts -g... yes\\nchecking for gcc option to accept ISO C89... none needed\\nchecking for style of include used by make...

bug.\n* Set to `true` if the issue is a real bug, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **is_fixed**\n\n* Whether the bug was fixed.\n* Set to `true` if the bug was fixed, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **number**\n\n* The issue number.\n* You already know this from the issue report input, but you need to output it as well.\n\n#### **found_pointer**\n\n* The version, commit hash, or pull request number where the bug was observed.\n* The primary aim here is to pinpoint the locations so that we can rollback and reproduce the bug.\n* If multiple of those are mentioned, you can add them all to the array.\n* Must come directly from the issue text or comments.\n* Return `[]` if not any kind of pointer to at which point the bug was found is explicitly stated.\n\n#### **fixed_pointer**\n\n* The version, commit hash, or pull request number where the bug was fixed.\n* If multiple of those are mentioned, you can add them all to the array.\n* Must come directly from the issue text or comments.\n* Return `[]` if not any kind of pointer to at which point the bug was fixed is explicitly stated.\n\n#### **bug_kind**\n\nChoose exactly one:\n\n| Value        | Meaning                                                                   |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **SEMANTIC** | Incorrect matching, parsing, or interpretation of patterns                |\n| **CRASH**    | Crashes, panics, segmentation faults, unrecoverable errors                |\n| **DIFF**     | Behavioral differences (across versions or engines)                       |\n| **BUILD**    | Build issues or compilation errors when building the engine               |\n| **PERF**     | Performance issues, backtracking blowups, unexplained

documentation** |\n| **OTHER**    | A genuine bug that does not fit any other category                        |\n\n\nFor `DIFF` bugs, behavioral differences can be observed in the two different versions of the same engine (e.g., new version vs. old version)\nand between different engines (e.g., tre vs. other engines). The behavioral difference can be in the acceptance of a pattern, \nthe span of the match, the captures, the number of matches, flag behavior, etc.\n\n#### **how_found**\n\nIdentify how the bug was discovered, if stated or there is enough evidence (e.g., usage of ASan for fuzzing):\n\n* FUZZING – found via fuzzing tools\n* STATIC_ANALYSIS – found via automated static analysis\n* MANUAL_REVIEW – found manually (e.g., user investigation)\n* DIFFERENTIAL_TESTING – found by comparing results with other engines\n* OTHER – explicitly stated custom method\n* `null` – if no discovery method is stated or implied\n\n#### **reproduction_pattern_and_input**\n\n* Extract all reproducible test cases provided.\n* Store each `(pattern, input)` pair separately (there can be multiple pairs).\n* Use `null` values only when the pattern or input is missing.\n* Sometimes, the provided pattern or input string is too long to be fit in the output format (e.g., excessive repeats of the same character or pattern).\n  * For example, the issue author might state a regex pattern or input similar to \"()()()...()\" (10000 times \"()\"). \n  * In this case, you can output a shorter representation like \"()()...()\" (50 times \"()\"). Mention that truncation in your summary.\n\n#### **log**\n\n* Include any crash logs, sanitizer output, stack traces, or diagnostic logs.\n* Store **exactly** what is provided, do not invent or summarize.\n* Use `null` if not present.\n\n#### **summary**\n\nA **2–6 sentence** explanation summarizing:\n\n* What the issue reports.\n* Whether and why it qualifies (or does not qualify) as a real bug.\n* Your reasoning for the chosen bug category and extracted fields.\n\nThis is the **only place where your reasoning may appear**.\nAll other fields should contain **no justification—only extracted data**.\n\n---\n\n# **If the Issue Is NOT a Real Bug**\n\nOutput the structure with all fields set to null or empty as below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"number\": \"1234567890\",\n    \"is_real_bug\": false,\n    \"is_fixed\": false,\n    \"found_pointer\": [],\n    \"fixed_pointer\": [],\n    \"bug_kind\": null,\n    \"how_found\": null,\n    \"reproduction_pattern_and_input\": [],\n    \"log\": null,\n    \"summary\": \"Explanation of why this issue does not represent a real bug.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe number and summary must still be present; all other fields must be null or empty.\n\n---\n\n# **General Constraints**\n\n1. **Do not guess.** Only extract what is explicitly stated or can be strongly inferred from the issue description and comments.\n2. **Do not modify or correct the issue's content.** Extract it faithfully.\n3. **Only JSON output, no extra text.**\n4. **Ensure JSON is valid, syntactically correct, and uses only the allowed values.**\n5. **Never fabricate version numbers, logs, or test cases.**\n6. **Be consistent and precise.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"number\": \"41\", \"title\": \"additional kind of error\", \"author\": \"AndrePeter\", \"labels\": [], \"description\": \"Great work!

But, there are bytes with the top bit turned on.  The files I have been seeing problems with contain some Unicode code points.  This, I believe is the key to why `printf(\\\"%.*s\\\", ...)` prints nothing but `fwrite()` works fine.  A casual reading of the man pages for printf(3) does not say anything about what the \\\"%.*s\\\" conversion is supposed to do with Unicode or with any 8-bit data.\\n\\nThis 8-bit data also accounts for other problems with dropped records.  When there are any characters in `[\\\\x80-\\\\xff]`, the call to `tre_regnexec()` can go off into the weeds and just not find the next delimiter, so it reads in the rest of the file as the last record.\\n\\nWhen I use the plain (Wu and Manber) agrep, `/usr/bin/agrep` with -d '^From ' on a mailbox, I get the correct number of records, but tre-agrep -d '^From ' produces far fewer records.  I suspect that this is not because Wu-Manber agrep is so much more sophisticated about Unicode and 8-bit cleanliness, in general; rather, it is because Wu-Manber agrep is old and simplistic and has a \\\"bytes-is-bytes\\\" view of all data, except that it is always line-oriented and has unpleasant limitations due to fixed buffer sizes, etc.\\n\\nI cannot say that this is a bug in tre-agrep, just a caveat, because the man page says nothing one way or another about Unicode or 8-bit characters.  But, I think it would be nice to make tre-agrep be able to find delimiters, even if it does not otherwise support Unicode or any 8-bit data.\\n\\n-- Guy Shaw\\n\"}]}"}]}}

"system", "content": "You are a **software engineering and cybersecurity researcher** specializing in **regular expression (regex) engine analysis**.\nYour research project aims to **systematically evaluate and categorize bugs** in regex engines by mining and interpreting historical issue reports.\n\nYou are currently analyzing the **tre** regex engine, developed by **laurikari**.\n\nFor each task, you will be given **one issue report** in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"number\": \"1234567890\",\n    \"title\": \"Issue Title\",\n    \"author\": \"johndoe\",\n    \"labels\": [\"bug\", \"feature\"],\n    \"description\": \"Issue Description\",\n    \"comments\": [\n        {\n            \"author\": \"johndoe\",\n            \"body\": \"Comment Body\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# **Your Goal**\n\nYour task is to decide whether the issue describes a **real bug** related to the tre regex engine and to **extract structured information** about the bug.\nYou must rely **only on the content explicitly stated or strongly implied** in the issue description and comments.\n\nIf the issue is **not** about an actual bug (e.g., question, misunderstanding, expected behavior, usage error, unsupported feature), then you must produce the **null-filled output** described later.\n\n---\n\n# **What Counts as a “Real Bug”**\n\n\nA real bug includes **any confirmed or strongly evidenced defect**, including:\n\n* **Semantic bugs**: incorrect match results, wrong interpretation of patterns.\n* **Crashes**: segmentation faults, aborts, panics.\n* **Performance bugs**: timeouts, catastrophic backtracking, unexpected slowdowns.\n* **Memory bugs**: leaks, buffer issues, tool-reported memory errors (ASan, UBSan, etc.).\n* **Differential bugs**: behavior differs between versions or across engines.\n* **Documentation bugs**: incorrect, misleading, incomplete, or inconsistent documentation associated with regex behavior or API usage.\n\nDo **not** classify as a bug:\n\n* misuse of the API\n* misunderstandings of regex semantics\n* invalid input or unsupported features\n* documentation or enhancement requests\n* behavioral questions with no confirmed fault\n\nWhen the existence of a bug is unclear, respond with **all null values**.\n\n---\n\n# **Output Format**\n\nYour output must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"number\": \"1234567890\",\n    \"is_real_bug\": true | false,\n    \"is_fixed\": true | false,\n    \"found_pointer\": [\n        {\n            \"type\":

\"summary\": \"Short summary of what the issue is about and the LLM's reasoning for the classification.\"\n}\n```\n\n### **Field Definitions**\n\n#### **is_real_bug**\n\n* Whether the issue is a real bug.\n* Set to `true` if the issue is a real bug, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **is_fixed**\n\n* Whether the bug was fixed.\n* Set to `true` if the bug was fixed, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **number**\n\n* The issue number.\n* You already know this from the issue report input, but you need to output it as well.\n\n#### **found_pointer**\n\n* The version, commit hash, or pull request number where the bug was observed.\n* The primary aim here is to pinpoint the locations so that we can rollback and reproduce the bug.\n* If multiple of those are mentioned, you can add them all to the array.\n* Must come directly from the issue text or comments.\n* Return `[]` if not any kind of pointer to at which point the bug was found is explicitly stated.\n\n#### **fixed_pointer**\n\n* The version, commit hash, or pull request number where the bug was fixed.\n* If multiple of those are mentioned, you can add them all to the array.\n* Must come directly from the issue text or comments.\n* Return `[]` if not any kind of pointer to at which point the bug was fixed is explicitly stated.\n\n#### **bug_kind**\n\nChoose exactly one:\n\n| Value        | Meaning                                                                   |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **SEMANTIC** | Incorrect matching, parsing, or interpretation of patterns                |\n| **CRASH**    | Crashes, panics, segmentation faults, unrecoverable errors                |\n| **DIFF**     | Behavioral differences (across versions or engines)                       |\n| **BUILD**    | Build issues or compilation errors when building the engine               |\n| **PERF**     | Performance issues, backtracking blowups, unexplained slowness            |\n| **MEMORY**   | Memory errors, leaks, invalid access, sanitizer outputs                   |\n| **DOC**      | **Documentation issues: misleading, incomplete, incorrect documentation** |\n| **OTHER**    | A genuine bug that does not fit any other category                        |\n\n\nFor `DIFF` bugs, behavioral differences can be observed in the two different versions of the same engine (e.g., new version vs. old version)\nand between different engines (e.g., tre vs. other engines). The behavioral difference can be in the acceptance of a pattern, \nthe span of the match, the captures, the number of matches, flag behavior, etc.\n\n#### **how_found**\n\nIdentify how the bug was discovered, if stated or there is enough evidence (e.g., usage of ASan for fuzzing):\n\n* FUZZING – found via fuzzing tools\n* STATIC_ANALYSIS – found via automated static analysis\n* MANUAL_REVIEW – found manually (e.g., user investigation)\n* DIFFERENTIAL_TESTING – found by comparing results with other engines\n* OTHER – explicitly stated custom method\n* `null` – if no discovery method is stated or implied\n\n#### **reproduction_pattern_and_input**\n\n* Extract all reproducible test cases provided.\n* Store each `(pattern, input)` pair separately (there can be multiple pairs).\n* Use `null` values only when the pattern or input is missing.\n* Sometimes, the provided pattern or input string is too long to be fit in the output format (e.g., excessive repeats of the same character or pattern).\n  * For example, the issue author might state a regex pattern or input similar to \"()()()...()\" (10000 times \"()\"). \n  * In this case, you can output a shorter representation like \"()()...()\" (50 times \"()\"). Mention that truncation in your summary.\n\n#### **log**\n\n* Include any crash logs, sanitizer output, stack traces, or diagnostic logs.\n* Store **exactly** what is provided, do not invent or summarize.\n* Use `null` if not present.\n\n#### **summary**\n\nA **2–6 sentence** explanation summarizing:\n\n* What the issue reports.\n* Whether and why it qualifies (or does not qualify) as a real bug.\n* Your reasoning for the chosen bug category and extracted fields.\n\nThis is the **only place where your reasoning may appear**.\nAll other fields should contain **no justification—only extracted data**.\n\n---\n\n# **If the Issue Is NOT a Real Bug**\n\nOutput the structure with all fields set to null or empty as below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"number\": \"1234567890\",\n    \"is_real_bug\": false,\n    \"is_fixed\": false,\n    \"found_pointer\": [],\n    \"fixed_pointer\": [],\n    \"bug_kind\": null,\n    \"how_found\": null,\n    \"reproduction_pattern_and_input\": [],\n    \"log\": null,\n    \"summary\": \"Explanation of why this issue does not represent a real bug.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe number and summary must still be present; all other fields must be null or empty.\n\n---\n\n# **General Constraints**\n\n1. **Do not guess.** Only extract what is explicitly stated or can be strongly inferred from the issue description and comments.\n2. **Do not modify or correct the issue's content.** Extract it faithfully.\n3. **Only JSON output, no extra text.**\n4. **Ensure JSON is valid, syntactically correct, and uses only the allowed values.**\n5. **Never fabricate version numbers, logs, or test cases.**\n6. **Be consistent and precise.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"number\": \"58\", \"title\": \"Segmentation faults 2017-05-15\", \"author\": \"rwhitworth\", \"labels\": [], \"description\": \"Hello,\\r\\nI was using American Fuzzy Lop (afl-fuzz) to fuzz input to a modified version of the `agrep` program on Linux.

includes **any confirmed or strongly evidenced defect**, including:\n\n* **Semantic bugs**: incorrect match results, wrong interpretation of patterns.\n* **Crashes**: segmentation faults, aborts, panics.\n* **Performance bugs**: timeouts, catastrophic backtracking, unexpected slowdowns.\n* **Memory bugs**: leaks, buffer issues, tool-reported memory errors (ASan, UBSan, etc.).\n* **Differential

bug.\n* Set to `true` if the issue is a real bug, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **is_fixed**\n\n* Whether the bug was fixed.\n* Set to `true` if the bug was fixed, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **number**\n\n* The issue number.\n* You already know this from the issue report input, but you need to output it as well.\n\n#### **found_pointer**\n\n* The version, commit hash, or pull request number where the bug was observed.\n* The primary aim here is to pinpoint the locations so that we can rollback and reproduce the bug.\n* If multiple of those are mentioned, you can add them all to the array.\n* Must come directly from the issue text or comments.\n* Return `[]` if not any kind of pointer to at which point the bug was found is explicitly stated.\n\n#### **fixed_pointer**\n\n* The version, commit hash, or pull request number where the bug was fixed.\n* If multiple of those are mentioned, you can add them all to the array.\n* Must come directly from the issue text or comments.\n* Return `[]` if not any kind of pointer to at which point the bug was fixed is explicitly stated.\n\n#### **bug_kind**\n\nChoose exactly one:\n\n| Value        | Meaning                                                                   |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **SEMANTIC** | Incorrect matching, parsing, or interpretation of patterns                |\n| **CRASH**    | Crashes, panics, segmentation faults, unrecoverable errors                |\n| **DIFF**     | Behavioral differences (across versions or engines)                       |\n| **BUILD**    | Build issues or compilation errors when building the engine               |\n| **PERF**     | Performance issues, backtracking blowups, unexplained

documentation** |\n| **OTHER**    | A genuine bug that does not fit any other category                        |\n\n\nFor `DIFF` bugs, behavioral differences can be observed in the two different versions of the same engine (e.g., new version vs. old version)\nand between different engines (e.g., tre vs. other engines). The behavioral difference can be in the acceptance of a pattern, \nthe span of the match, the captures, the number of matches, flag behavior, etc.\n\n#### **how_found**\n\nIdentify how the bug was discovered, if stated or there is enough evidence (e.g., usage of ASan for fuzzing):\n\n* FUZZING – found via fuzzing tools\n* STATIC_ANALYSIS – found via automated static analysis\n* MANUAL_REVIEW – found manually (e.g., user investigation)\n* DIFFERENTIAL_TESTING – found by comparing results with other engines\n* OTHER – explicitly stated custom method\n* `null` – if no discovery method is stated or implied\n\n#### **reproduction_pattern_and_input**\n\n* Extract all reproducible test cases provided.\n* Store each `(pattern, input)` pair separately (there can be multiple pairs).\n* Use `null` values only when the pattern or input is missing.\n* Sometimes, the provided pattern or input string is too long to be fit in the output format (e.g., excessive repeats of the same character or pattern).\n  * For example, the issue author might state a regex pattern or input similar to \"()()()...()\" (10000 times \"()\"). \n  * In this case, you can output a shorter representation like \"()()...()\" (50 times \"()\"). Mention that truncation in your summary.\n\n#### **log**\n\n* Include any crash logs, sanitizer output, stack traces, or diagnostic logs.\n* Store **exactly** what is provided, do not invent or summarize.\n* Use `null` if not present.\n\n#### **summary**\n\nA **2–6 sentence** explanation summarizing:\n\n* What the issue reports.\n* Whether and why it qualifies (or does not qualify) as a real bug.\n* Your reasoning for the chosen bug category and extracted fields.\n\nThis is the **only place where your reasoning may appear**.\nAll other fields should contain **no justification—only extracted data**.\n\n---\n\n# **If the Issue Is NOT a Real Bug**\n\nOutput the structure with all fields set to null or empty as below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"number\": \"1234567890\",\n    \"is_real_bug\": false,\n    \"is_fixed\": false,\n    \"found_pointer\": [],\n    \"fixed_pointer\": [],\n    \"bug_kind\": null,\n    \"how_found\": null,\n    \"reproduction_pattern_and_input\": [],\n    \"log\": null,\n    \"summary\": \"Explanation of why this issue does not represent a real bug.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe number and summary must still be present; all other fields must be null or empty.\n\n---\n\n# **General Constraints**\n\n1. **Do not guess.** Only extract what is explicitly stated or can be strongly inferred from the issue description and comments.\n2. **Do not modify or correct the issue's content.** Extract it faithfully.\n3. **Only JSON output, no extra text.**\n4. **Ensure JSON is valid, syntactically correct, and uses only the allowed values.**\n5. **Never fabricate version numbers, logs, or test cases.**\n6. **Be consistent and precise.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"number\": \"59\", \"title\": \"TRE fail to parse this \", \"author\": \"mingodad\", \"labels\": [], \"description\": \"Hello !\\r\\nJust testing tre I found that it doesn't match correctly the following regular expression (note grep do manage it correctly)\\r\\n```\\r\\nthe total value is 12.345,89 with a discount of 5,50%\\r\\n```\\r\\n```\\r\\ncommon_args=\\\" -e '-?\\\\d[\\\\d.]*,\\\\d\\\\d' test-bug.txt\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\ncmd=\\\"grep -P $common_args\\\"\\r\\necho $cmd\\r\\n$cmd\\r\\n\\r\\ncmd=\\\"../src/agrep --color $common_args\\\"\\r\\necho $cmd\\r\\n$cmd\\r\\n```\", \"comments\": [{\"author\": \"mvkorpel\", \"body\": \"If you intend to match `12.345,89` I think you should use `[[:digit:].]` instead of `[\\\\d.]`.

I am used to work with third-party APIs that expose TRE, but for the first time I will need to use it directly from within C++.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, here is what I did. I downloaded a copy of the repository and followed the build instructions:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n./configure\\r\\nmake\\r\\nmake check\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that point, all checks seemed to work without any errors until the `agrep` test stage, where only one test is passed - all the rest fail. In the test log, I see many many identical errors:\\r\\n\\r\\n`error while loading shared libraries: libtre.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of further testing, I then continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n`make install`\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything else seems to proceed wit no additional errors. Next, I tried to compile a small test code from a file called `test.cpp`, located  in the root folder, that contains merely:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nextern \\\"C\\\" {\\r\\n#include \\\"tre/lib/tre.h\\\"\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nint main()\\r\\n{\\r\\n    regex_t tgt;\\r\\n    tre_regcomp(&tgt, \\\"First Try\\\", REG_EXTENDED);\\r\\n\\r\\n    return 0;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I compile with `g++ test.cpp -ltre`, still no error thrown. However, when I then try `./a.out`, I get the error:\\r\\n\\r\\n`./a.out: error while loading shared libraries: libtre.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`\\r\\n\\r\\nHow could I solve such issues?\", \"comments\": [{\"author\": \"cben\", \"body\": \"Some tips:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `ldd ./a.out` will should you what libraries files the binary requires.  But this will probably say `libtre.so.5`, duh, not too helpful here.\\r\\n- `find -name '*.so*'`.  For me this prints:\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n  ./lib/.libs/libtre.so.5\\r\\n  ./lib/.libs/libtre.so.5.0.0\\r\\n  ./lib/.libs/libtre.so\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n- Your final `g++ test.cpp -ltre` assumes it got installed in the standard system locations.  Did `make install` actually put it there?  Default prefix should put it at `/usr/local/lib/libtre.so.5.0.0`.  Maybe you needed `sudo make install` (though it should have failed if permissions are the issue).\\r\\n- Look at output of `make check` (maybe `make clean; make` first) for compilation commands, what it's linking to.  Specifically, search for `libtre`.  For me, it links to `../lib/.libs/libtre.so`:\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n  libtool: link: gcc -g -O2 -Wall -o .libs/test-str-source test-str-source.o  ../lib/.libs/libtre.so -lm -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/local/lib\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if I `rm lib/.libs/libtre.so*`, then `make check` fails with same error as you wrote (in `tests/agrep/test-suite.log`).\\r\\nAnd then, even `make && make check` doesn't help, the lib is not re-built.\\r\\n=> **So maybe your dir is stuck in some broken state. Try `make clean; make; make check`.**\"}]}"}]}}

I think my unease with all this is that it makes\\nregex matching locale dependent, and not in a nice way.  Consider the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n   1) You have some crowd sourced data, such as tags for photos or\\n      music.\\n\\n   2) Because it is crowd sourced, it can easily be in different\\n      languages, even if it is all stored in UTF-8 (or whatever),\\n      so it would have to have some sort of locale information\\n      stored with the value.\\n\\n   3) Matching character classes like [:alpha:] correctly in that\\n      data means defining the classes differently for different\\n      pieces of data.  You would have to provide a locale for the\\n      data at _match_ time, not for the regex at compile time.\\n\\nI suppose from an implementation viewpoint, the classes could be handled\\nby adding a locale parameter to the regex match function and some sort\\nof plugin accessed by the match function code.  The problem is that then\\nyou need the plugins, and your nice clean regex library suddenly has a\\nvery large and somewhat loosely defined dependency.\\n\\nI didn't look at the details of the language testing in that stack\\noverflow discussion, but I didn't see any of them passing a locale at\\nmatch time, it all seems to be passing or picking a default locale at\\ncompile time, so none of them are going to work properly on multligual\\ndata :(.\\n\\nAs an alternative, I suppose we could hope that all Unicode codepoints\\nhave language independent classification.  I don't know enough about\\nUnicode to know if that is realistic, but if it is then a character\\nclass definition could be implemented that checked by codepoint value\\nindependent of language.  Then all we have to do is persuade the\\nUnicode people to stop adding codepoints :).\\n\\nJust to add one final complication, how should these\\nnot-yet-perfectly-defined character classes work with approximate\\nmatching?\\n\\nI do not think there really is an answer right now (2023), but I can\\nhope for more multilingual programmers than I to come up with one :).\\nUntil then, I think documenting the issue (as you suggested) is the\\nbest we can do.\\n\\n> -- \\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\\n> https://github.com/laurikari/tre/issues/88#issuecomment-1575713003\\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\\n> \\n> Message ID: ***@***.***>\\n\\nCheers,\\n--\\nTom Rushworth\\n\"}, {\"author\": \"bbolker\", \"body\": \"Honestly, I'm not too worried about this.

I'm not positive how the install location gets set\\nin the autotools though.  It's building the library from source that has\\nto get a specific header, different from anything that might have been\\ninstalled at some earlier time.  The installed header\\n\\\"include/tre/tre-config.h\\\" is different for different build\\nconfigurations (e.g. if you are using wide characters or not).

The changes in\\n32b2d6b4... are ugly, but compiler and platform independent, and\\nguarantee the library, agrep, and the python extension all get built\\nwith the same headers from configuration.\\n\\nThe issue is probably pretty rare if you are building only one\\nconfiguration on one platform, because you are probably choosing the\\nsame configuration each time you do it (so any installed headers are\\nthe same as your build headers).

}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# **Your Goal**\n\nYour task is to decide whether the issue describes a **real bug** related to the tre regex engine and to **extract structured information** about the bug.\nYou must rely **only on the content explicitly stated or strongly implied** in the issue description and comments.\n\nIf the issue is **not** about an actual bug (e.g., question, misunderstanding, expected behavior, usage error, unsupported feature), then you must produce the **null-filled output** described later.\n\n---\n\n# **What Counts as a “Real Bug”**\n\n\nA real bug includes **any confirmed or strongly evidenced defect**, including:\n\n* **Semantic bugs**: incorrect match results, wrong interpretation of patterns.\n* **Crashes**: segmentation faults, aborts, panics.\n* **Performance bugs**: timeouts, catastrophic backtracking, unexpected slowdowns.\n* **Memory bugs**: leaks, buffer issues, tool-reported memory errors (ASan, UBSan, etc.).\n* **Differential bugs**: behavior differs between versions or across engines.\n* **Documentation bugs**: incorrect, misleading, incomplete, or inconsistent documentation associated with regex behavior or API usage.\n\nDo **not** classify as a bug:\n\n* misuse of the API\n* misunderstandings of regex semantics\n* invalid input or unsupported features\n* documentation or enhancement requests\n* behavioral questions with no confirmed fault\n\nWhen the existence of a bug is unclear, respond with **all null values**.\n\n---\n\n# **Output Format**\n\nYour output must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"number\": \"1234567890\",\n    \"is_real_bug\": true | false,\n    \"is_fixed\": true | false,\n    \"found_pointer\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"Version\" | \"Commit Hash\" | \"Pull Request Number\" | \"Other\" | null,\n            \"value\": \"Value\" | null\n        }\n    ],\n    \"fixed_pointer\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"Version\" | \"Commit Hash\" | \"Pull Request Number\" | \"Other\" | null,\n            \"value\": \"Value\" | null\n        }\n    ],\n    \"bug_kind\": \"SEMANTIC\" | \"CRASH\" | \"DIFF\" | \"PERF\" | \"MEMORY\" | \"DOC\" | \"OTHER\" | null,\n    \"how_found\": \"FUZZING\" | \"STATIC_ANALYSIS\" | \"MANUAL_REVIEW\" | \"DIFFERENTIAL_TESTING\" | \"OTHER\" | null,\n    \"reproduction_pattern_and_input\": [\n        {\n            \"pattern\": \"Pattern\" | null,\n            \"input\": \"Input\" | null\n        }\n    ],\n    \"log\": \"Log\" | null,\n    \"summary\": \"Short summary of what the issue is about and the LLM's reasoning for the classification.\"\n}\n```\n\n### **Field Definitions**\n\n#### **is_real_bug**\n\n* Whether the issue is a real bug.\n* Set to `true` if the issue is a real bug, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **is_fixed**\n\n* Whether the bug was fixed.\n* Set to `true` if the bug was fixed, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### **number**\n\n* The issue number.\n* You already know this from the issue report input, but you need to output it as well.\n\n#### **found_pointer**\n\n* The version, commit hash, or pull request number where the bug was observed.\n* The primary aim here is to pinpoint the locations so that we can rollback and reproduce the bug.\n* If multiple of those are mentioned, you can add them all to the array.\n* Must come directly from the issue text or comments.\n* Return `[]` if not any kind of pointer to at which point the bug was found is explicitly stated.\n\n#### **fixed_pointer**\n\n* The version, commit hash, or pull request number where the bug was fixed.\n* If multiple of those are mentioned, you can add them all to the array.\n* Must come directly from the issue text or comments.\n* Return `[]` if not any kind of pointer to at which point the bug was fixed is explicitly stated.\n\n#### **bug_kind**\n\nChoose exactly one:\n\n| Value        | Meaning                                                                   |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **SEMANTIC** | Incorrect matching, parsing, or interpretation of patterns                |\n| **CRASH**    | Crashes, panics, segmentation faults, unrecoverable errors                |\n| **DIFF**     | Behavioral differences (across versions or engines)                       |\n| **BUILD**    | Build issues or compilation errors when building the engine               |\n| **PERF**     | Performance issues, backtracking blowups, unexplained slowness            |\n| **MEMORY**   | Memory errors, leaks, invalid access, sanitizer outputs                   |\n| **DOC**      | **Documentation issues: misleading, incomplete, incorrect documentation** |\n| **OTHER**    | A genuine bug that does not fit any other category                        |\n\n\nFor `DIFF` bugs, behavioral differences can be observed in the two different versions of the same engine (e.g., new version vs. old version)\nand between different engines (e.g., tre vs. other engines). The behavioral difference can be in the acceptance of a pattern, \nthe span of the match, the captures, the number of matches, flag behavior, etc.\n\n#### **how_found**\n\nIdentify how the bug was discovered, if stated or there is enough evidence (e.g., usage of ASan for fuzzing):\n\n* FUZZING – found via fuzzing tools\n* STATIC_ANALYSIS – found via automated static analysis\n* MANUAL_REVIEW – found manually (e.g., user investigation)\n* DIFFERENTIAL_TESTING – found by comparing results with other engines\n* OTHER – explicitly stated custom method\n* `null` – if no discovery method is stated or implied\n\n#### **reproduction_pattern_and_input**\n\n* Extract all reproducible test cases provided.\n* Store each `(pattern, input)` pair separately (there can be multiple pairs).\n* Use `null` values only when the pattern or input is missing.\n* Sometimes, the provided pattern or input string is too long to be fit in the output format (e.g., excessive repeats of the same character or pattern).\n  * For example, the issue author might state a regex pattern or input similar to \"()()()...()\" (10000 times \"()\"). \n  * In this case, you can output a shorter representation like \"()()...()\" (50 times \"()\"). Mention that truncation in your summary.\n\n#### **log**\n\n* Include any crash logs, sanitizer output, stack traces, or diagnostic logs.\n* Store **exactly** what is provided, do not invent or summarize.\n* Use `null` if not present.\n\n#### **summary**\n\nA **2–6 sentence** explanation summarizing:\n\n* What the issue reports.\n* Whether and why it qualifies (or does not qualify) as a real bug.\n* Your reasoning for the chosen bug category and extracted fields.\n\nThis is the **only place where your reasoning may appear**.\nAll other fields should contain **no justification—only extracted data**.\n\n---\n\n# **If the Issue Is NOT a Real Bug**\n\nOutput the structure with all fields set to null or empty as below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"number\": \"1234567890\",\n    \"is_real_bug\": false,\n    \"is_fixed\": false,\n    \"found_pointer\": [],\n    \"fixed_pointer\": [],\n    \"bug_kind\": null,\n    \"how_found\": null,\n    \"reproduction_pattern_and_input\": [],\n    \"log\": null,\n    \"summary\": \"Explanation of why this issue does not represent a real bug.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe number and summary must still be present; all other fields must be null or empty.\n\n---\n\n# **General Constraints**\n\n1. **Do not guess.** Only extract what is explicitly stated or can be strongly inferred from the issue description and comments.\n2. **Do not modify or correct the issue's content.** Extract it faithfully.\n3. **Only JSON output, no extra text.**\n4. **Ensure JSON is valid, syntactically correct, and uses only the allowed values.**\n5. **Never fabricate version numbers, logs, or test cases.**\n6. **Be consistent and precise.**\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"number\": \"125\", \"title\": \"Fix the bug\", \"author\": \"RajShahSanatani\", \"labels\": [], \"description\": \"\", \"comments\": []}"}]}}
