# Paper Tables

This directory contains LaTeX tables used in the paper.

## Tables

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bug_summary.tex` | Bug statistics per engine (Section 5.1) |
| `cve_summary.tex` | CVE statistics by engine and severity (Section 5.2) |

## Table Descriptions

### `bug_summary.tex`

A LaTeX table fragment showing bug statistics for each of the 11 third-party regex engines analyzed:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Engine | Display name of the regex engine |
| Issues | Total GitHub issues analyzed |
| Bugs | Confirmed bugs identified |
| Bug Rate | Percentage of issues that are real bugs |
| Fixed | Number of bugs that have been resolved |
| Fix Rate | Percentage of bugs that have been fixed |

**Key Statistics**:
- Total issues: 2,342
- Total bugs: 1,007 (43% bug rate)
- Fix rate: 55.5%

### `cve_summary.tex`

A LaTeX table fragment showing CVE statistics by engine and severity level:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Engine | Regex engine name |
| Critical | Number of critical-severity CVEs |
| High | Number of high-severity CVEs |
| Medium | Number of medium-severity CVEs |
| Other | CVEs with low/no score |
| Total | Total CVE count |

**Key Statistics**:
- Total CVEs: 156
- Critical: 32 (21%)
- High: 45 (29%)
- PCRE alone: 50 CVEs (32% of total)

## Regeneration

These tables are generated by the analysis scripts:

```bash
# Bug summary table
python scripts/analysis/regexbugbench_analysis.py

# CVE summary table
python scripts/analysis/cve_analysis.py
```

Output files are written to:
- `data/bug_analysis/tables/bug_summary.tex`
- `data/cve_analysis/tables/cve_summary.tex`

## Usage in LaTeX

Include these tables in your LaTeX document:

```latex
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Bug Statistics per Regex Engine}
\input{tables/bug_summary}
\end{table}
```

## Note on Other Tables

The paper also contains:
- **Table 1**: Feature comparison of 22 regex engines (68 features across 13 categories)
- **Table 2**: Testing techniques employed by 22 regex engines
- **Table 3**: Metamorphic relations implemented in ReTest

These tables are included directly in the paper's LaTeX source and are not generated from data files. The raw data for Table 1 and Table 2 comes from our manual engineering review of regex engine documentation and source code. Table 3 is a catalog of the 16 metamorphic relations derived from Kleene algebra (see `docs/metamorphic_relations.md`).
